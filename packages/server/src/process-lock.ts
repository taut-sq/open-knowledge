/**
 * Release the lock. Safe to call multiple times. Only removes the lock if
 * we own it (pid AND machine match; hostname for legacy locks) — prevents a
 * rogue process from unlinking a real server's lock. The machine check
 * matters on shared content directories (NFS-mounted home, remote content
 * volumes) where two machines can legitimately run processes with the same
 * pid — without the check we'd unlink a peer's lock.
 *
 * Refcount-aware: when this process holds multiple active acquires for the
 * same lockPath (Vite plugin per-`configureServer` createServer lifecycle),
 * release decrements the in-process refcount; the file is only unlinked
 * when the LAST active acquire releases. See `activeLockRefs` for the bug
 * class this protects against.
 *
 * `deferUnlinkToExit` — the teardown-to-exit contract. When set and the
 * refcount reaches zero, the file is NOT unlinked now: it stays on disk
 * marked `draining` and the process-exit handler (registered at acquire)
 * removes it when the process actually dies. This closes the window where
 * a released lock made a still-alive server invisible, so supervisors and
 * discovery spawned a duplicate alongside it. Callers whose process keeps
 * living after the release (error-path cleanup, the Vite dev plugin's
 * restart cycle) MUST leave this unset — deferring there would leave a
 * live-pid draining lock that blocks every future start until the dev
 * process dies.
