/**
 * Per-process LRU cache of docNames that have been renamed away or deleted
 * since the server booted. Read by the `removalRedirectGuard`
 * `onAuthenticate` extension to reject incoming WebSocket connections to
 * stale docNames before any Y.Doc work runs — the single enforcement point
 * that prevents IDB-resync from recreating the file at the OLD path.
 *
 * Insertion-order semantics are inherited from `JS Map`: every set or
 * lookup that promotes (`get`) deletes-then-sets to move the entry to the
 * back of insertion order, so the front is always the least-recently-used.
 * Eviction at `capacity` removes the front entry. Pattern mirrors
 * `latestDiskAckSVs` in `cc1-broadcast.ts`.
 *
 * STOP rule for consumers: `isSystemDoc()` and `isConfigDoc()` are NOT
 * filtered inside this class — the cache MUST never hold synthetic docs,
 * and every populate site (rename spine, delete handler, watcher reconcile,
 * watcher add invalidation) is responsible for short-circuiting on those
 * predicates BEFORE calling `setRenamed` / `setDeleted`. Centralizing the
 * filter here would hide policy in a data structure; keeping it at the
 * call sites makes the contract auditable.
