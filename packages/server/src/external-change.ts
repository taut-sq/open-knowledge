/**
 * L1 reconcile-before-apply (the primary disk-authority fix). Before an MCP
 * agent content write applies its edit, ingest a divergent out-of-band disk
 * edit so the agent edits the live (disk-reflecting) doc instead of clobbering
 * a newer disk version with stale loaded CRDT state.
 *
 * Detection: compare the current on-disk bytes against `getReconciledBase`
 * (the last content this server synced to/from disk for the doc) using
 * `normalizeBridge` — the SAME comparator the store uses (persistence.ts
 * `markdownSemanticallyUnchanged`) and the L3 backstop uses, so the layers
 * never disagree on what counts as "diverged" (a split comparator would yield
 * a redundant double-ingest or a gap). On a genuine divergence the disk content
 * routes through the SAME three-way `reconcile()` the file-watcher 'update'
 * path uses — base = reconciledBase, ours = the live Y.Text (which may carry
 * collaborative edits persistence has not flushed yet), theirs = disk bytes —
 * so a concurrent un-flushed CRDT edit survives alongside the disk edit
 * instead of being wholesale-replaced:
 *
 *   - `clean` (no un-flushed edits): ingest disk as-is.
 *   - `merged`: ingest the merged content, then advance the reconciled base
 *     to the DISK bytes. The base must track what is actually on disk: the
 *     L3 store backstop compares disk against the base with the same
 *     comparator, so a base pointing at the (memory-only) merged content
 *     would abort the caller's forced flush as a phantom divergence — and
 *     the watcher's own queued event for the same disk write must reconcile
 *     to `noop` (theirs === base) rather than re-ingest.
 *   - `conflicts` / `refused`: ingest NOTHING and mark the doc's lifecycle
 *     conflict state, so the caller's mutating write is refused through the
 *     uniform `DocInConflictError` gate (agent-sessions.ts). The file
 *     watcher's own event for the same disk change owns conflict
 *     materialization per its existing semantics — pre-consuming it here
 *     would just add a second ingestion style.
 *
 * Ingests go through the sanctioned `applyExternalChange` (FILE_WATCHER_ORIGIN,
 * paired-write, `skipStoreHooks`): the ingest fires NO store, so the caller's
 * subsequent agent write is the single store that persists the combined
 * content — and the FILE_WATCHER_ORIGIN identity keeps the ingest out of the
 * agent's `UndoManager`. The caller then applies the agent edit on top in its
 * own `session.dc.document.transact(fn, session.origin)` — two sequential
 * transacts, never nested.
 *
 * Returns `reconciled: true` when an external edit was ingested (the caller
 * surfaces the `disk-edit-reconciled` success warning, discriminated by
 * `mergeOutcome`), `reconciled: false` otherwise.
 *
 * Scoped to content writes (write / edit / frontmatter); the
 * undo/rollback handlers are NOT callers — reconcile-rewriting the doc before
 * `Y.UndoManager.undo()` would invalidate the undo-stack items. Those rely on
 * the L3 store-time backstop instead.
 *
 * No-op (returns `false`) when: the doc is a system/config doc; the server has
 * no `reconciledBase` for it (a loaded doc always has one from
 * `onLoadDocument`, so an absent base is the not-yet-loaded edge — no baseline
 * to diverge from); the doc has no disk file yet (first write); the path
 * realpath-escapes the content dir (symlink-escape — refuse to read foreign
 * bytes into the CRDT, mirroring the persistence write-path guard); a read
 * fails transiently; or disk matches the base. Ingesting ONLY on genuine
 * divergence keeps `applyExternalChange`'s `FILE_SYSTEM_WRITER` attribution
 * honest — it fires exactly when disk really did change out of band.
 *
 * mtime-gating (perf nicety — skip the read when the file is unchanged) is
 * intentionally deferred: a markdown `readFileSync`
 * per agent write is negligible. Tracked as a conscious deferral.
