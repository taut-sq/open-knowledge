/**
 * Stable per-machine identity for process-lock ownership checks.
 *
 * `os.hostname()` is NOT stable on macOS — it follows the network-derived
 * kernel hostname (DHCP/DNS renames, user renames in System Settings), and a
 * rename makes every lock written under the old name look foreign. A lock
 * that looks foreign gets replaced even though its holder is alive on this
 * very machine, which is how duplicate servers per contentDir happen.
 *
 * Instead we mint a random UUID once and persist it at `~/.ok/machine-id`
 * (owner-only, mode 0600 — sibling of `~/.ok/auth.yml` and `~/.ok/logs/`).
 * Deliberately NOT a hardware identifier (IOPlatformUUID, /etc/machine-id):
 * those need platform-specific subprocess calls in the boot-critical lock
 * path, and writing persistent hardware IDs into lock files that can land on
 * shared volumes is a needless privacy leak.
 *
 * Scope note: the file lives under the user's home, so two OS user accounts
 * on one machine get different IDs. That is safe because every lock judgment
 * that involves a foreign/unknown machine ID falls back to local pid
 * liveness and fails CLOSED (collision, not stale-replace) — see
 * `acquireProcessLock`.
 *
 * Failure posture: if `~/.ok` is unreadable/unwritable, fall back to an
 * ephemeral per-process UUID. Locks written under an ephemeral ID look
 * foreign to every other process, which degrades to the same fail-closed
 * pid-liveness judgment — never to silent lock replacement.
