/**
 * `open-knowledge start` — collab server only (Hocuspocus + /api/*).
 *
 * Lifecycle split:
 * - `ok start` owns the WebSocket (/collab) + HTTP API (/api/*) and advertises
 *   its port via `server.lock`. Static React assets are served by `ok ui`.
 * - On startup we auto-spawn `ok ui` as a detached sibling when `ui.lock` is
 *   absent or stale. A pre-existing live UI is left alone.
 * - Idle-shutdown counts WebSocket upgrades at `/collab` only; it is blind
 *   to DirectConnections by design. When the threshold fires we SIGTERM the
 *   UI sibling before releasing our own lock.
 *
 * The Commander action is a thin wrapper around `bootStartServer` — that
 * boot function returns a `BootedStartServer` handle (`{httpServer, destroy,
 * port, ready, ...}`) so integration tests can drive the same composed boot
 * path the CLI uses, without process-level signal coupling.
