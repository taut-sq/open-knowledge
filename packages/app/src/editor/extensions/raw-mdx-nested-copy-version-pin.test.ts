/**
 * Version-pin guard for copy-out-of-the-nested-CodeMirror-box behavior.
 *
 * Why a version pin and not a browser E2E:
 *
 * A real-browser probe copied a sub-selection out of an unregistered
 * component's nested rawMdxFallback CodeMirror box and observed that the
 * clipboard is POPULATED — the ProseMirror #1068
 * empty-clipboard-under-mouse-focus class does not reproduce here, even
 * though the outer ProseMirror holds a NodeSelection on the raw box while the
 * selection lives inside the nested editable (the exact #1068 topology).
 *
 * The behavior is owned entirely by third-party code: CodeMirror's own copy
 * handler writes the sub-selection to `text/plain`, and prosemirror-view's DOM
 * copy handler declines to overwrite it. No Open-Knowledge-owned lever
 * reproduces the empty-clipboard class — flipping the raw box NodeView's
 * `stopEvent` does not change the outcome. A browser E2E asserting "clipboard
 * populated" would therefore be non-falsifiable by any in-repo regression, and
 * the exact copied text is word-wrap-dependent (visual-line selection), so an
 * exact-string assertion would flake. Both make such an E2E a permanently-
 * green smoke check rather than a guard.
 *
 * What genuinely gates the observed-good behavior is the resolved version of
 * the two packages that own the copy handlers: prosemirror-view (transitive
 * via @tiptap/pm — no direct dep to bump) and @codemirror/view (direct dep).
 * This guard floors both at the versions the probe verified. A downgrade below
 * either — e.g. a @tiptap/pm bump that pulls an older prosemirror-view, or a
 * @codemirror/view downgrade — trips the guard so someone re-runs the browser
 * probe before shipping. Forward drift within the floor passes untouched.
 *
 * This follows the same resolve-and-assert shape other version-floor guards
 * in the repo use.
