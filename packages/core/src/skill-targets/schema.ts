/**
 * Schema for the per-project skill-targets store at
 * `<projectDir>/.ok/skill-targets.json`.
 *
 * The editable set of editor host dirs OK projects skills into. Unlike the
 * installed-skills marker (`.ok/local/`, per-machine), this lives at `.ok/`
 * root — COMMITTED, so teammates inherit one target set. Changing it
 * re-projects every managed skill (authored + OK's shipped `open-knowledge`
 * bundle) to the new set and reverse-projects from dropped editors.
 *
 * Kept out of `config.yml` deliberately: config is a CRDT Y.Text doc with no
 * programmatic field-patch path, whereas this is a plain atomically-writable
 * JSON file the change-targets action can update server-side. When the file is
 * absent, OK falls back to the editors the project is already configured for.
 *
 * Only editors with a project skill surface are valid targets
 * (`claude` / `cursor` / `codex` / `opencode` / `pi`; Claude Desktop, OpenClaw,
 * and Antigravity read user-global skills only).
