 * directive `prompt` and the project / folder path.
 *
 * The URL builders thread `prompt` (when non-empty) into the per-target
 * prompt query param (`q=` / `prompt=` / `text=`) regardless of scope. The
 * caller (`runHandoffDispatch`) composes the right scope-specific prompt —
 * file directive, folder directive, or project directive — and the builder
 * just encodes it. An empty `prompt` is a defensive fallback that drops the
 * query param.
 *

 * (project scope) wrap the sentinel construction so call sites never pass
