/**
 * Main-process window manager — spawns BrowserWindow + utilityProcess pairs
 * per project, with an attach branch that reuses an existing live same-host
 * OpenKnowledge server (CLI sibling, another Electron instance, or any
 * bootServer caller).
 *
 * Each project window either:
 *   - (spawn mode, the common case) owns one `utilityProcess.fork` with
 *     `windowLifecycleBound: true, windowLifecycleGraceTime: 6000` + a
 *     BrowserWindow with preload-injected `--ok-collab-url` argv flags.
 *   - (attach mode) just owns the BrowserWindow;
 *     `window.okDesktop.config.collabUrl` points at the already-listening
 *     server, nothing is torn down on close. `ProjectContext.ownsServer ===
 *     false` gates every lifecycle action.
 *
 * Attach trigger: `<contentDir>/.ok/local/server.lock` references a
 * live same-host pid with `port > 0`. Stale locks flow through `runClean`
 * first, then spawn-mode proceeds.
 *
 * If a project's contentDir is already open in another window of THIS app,
 * surface "Focus existing window" instead of spawning a duplicate. Tracked
 * via `Map<contentDir, ProjectContext>`.
 *

   *   - **Slim single-file boot** in a throwaway temp `projectDir` (git + MCP
   *     off, content scoped to the one doc): no `.ok/` lands in the user's dir.
   *   - **Deterministic teardown** on window-close: a detached server would
   *     otherwise survive the close. The `'closed'`
   *     handler terminates the pid then removes the temp dir, sequentially.
   *
   * Requires the ephemeral deps (`createEphemeralProjectDir`,
   * `spawnDetachedServer`, `removeDir`) to be wired — there is no fallback for an
   * ephemeral session, so an unwired dep is a programming error, not a
