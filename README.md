# Open Knowledge

Open Knowledge is a local-first knowledge base for teams that want docs, help-center content, SOPs, and agent-facing knowledge to live in one structured editing system.

The project includes a desktop app, web app, server, CLI, shared core packages, and docs site. It uses Bun workspaces and Turbo for builds.

## Install

**macOS:** download the desktop app — open the DMG, drag **Open Knowledge** to **Applications**, and launch it. [Latest release](https://github.com/inkeep/open-knowledge/releases/latest).

**Linux or an Intel Mac:** run the same editor as a local web app via the CLI (Windows isn't supported yet) ([Node.js 24+](https://nodejs.org) required):

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/open-knowledge
cd your-project
ok init          # scaffold the project + wire up Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex
ok start --open  # serve the editor and open it in your browser
```

## Repository Model

This public repository is mirrored from Inkeep's internal monorepo with Copybara. The internal source path is `public/open-knowledge/` in `inkeep/agents-private`.

Public pull requests are welcome. When a public PR opens here, automation mirrors it into the internal monorepo for review and merge. After the internal PR lands, Copybara syncs the accepted change back to this repository.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contribution flow and [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for agent-facing development guidance.

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3.13 or newer (pinned in [`.bun-version`](./.bun-version))
- Node.js 24 or newer (pinned in [`.node-version`](./.node-version))
- Git

If you use a Node version manager, pin Node 24 with `fnm install`, `volta install node@24`, or `mise install`. Earlier Node versions fail `engines` checks during `bun install`.

bun install
bun run check

Run the app locally:

```bash
bun run --filter @inkeep/open-knowledge-app dev
